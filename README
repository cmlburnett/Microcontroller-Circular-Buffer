Microcontroller Circular Buffer

I looked everywhere for circular buffer implemenation suitable for a
microcontroller.  The key limitation is the absence of a malloc so the
circular buffer implementation would have to work with a statically
declared memory space.  Additionally, it would have to work with bytes
and nothing else.

I wrote this from scratch for my needs.
