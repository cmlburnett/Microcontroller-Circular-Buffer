Microcontroller Circular Buffer

I looked everywhere for circular buffer implemenation suitable for a
microcontroller.  The key limitation is the absence of a malloc so the
circular buffer implementation would have to work with a statically
declared memory space.  Additionally, it would have to work with bytes
and nothing else.

I wrote this from scratch for my needs.

Included is cbufftest.c that does some simple test cases.  You can
also use it to see how to use it.

Taken from cbufftest.c:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
	long ret;
	unsigned char buff[12];
	unsigned char hey[21];
	cbuff_t c;

	cbuff_init(&c, buff, 12);

	cbuff_enqueue(&c, (unsigned char*)"Hello", 5);

	ret = cbuff_dequeue1(&c);

	ret = cbuff_dequeue(&c, hey, 20);
---------------------------------------------------------------------
